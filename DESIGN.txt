There's a number of households.  In each there are people talking among
themselves (not all the time).  Every person has a voice (it's possible for two
different persons to have the same voice).  The game has a number of
prerecorded phrases for each voice.  There are two kinds of phrases: benign and
suspicious.  There are two kinds of people: obedient citizens (who use only
benign phrases) and terrorists (who use both benign and suspicious phrases).
Every household has only one kind of people in it: either terrorists or
obedient citizens.

The point of the game is to eavesdrop conversations and send SWAT teams to
households.  You get points if you capture terrorists.  You lose points if you
arrest good citizens.

You have 16 listening stations in front of you, each of which is capable of
eavesdroping a single household.  You can tune in or tune out.  You hear
all the conversations from listening stations you've turned on simultaneously,
which makes the game difficult.  There are buttons to send SWAT teams.  When
you do that, that particular listening station is switched to a new household
after a certain time.

There's a time limit for each level.
