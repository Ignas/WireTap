Hello, and welcome to the interactive tutorial. You can see a
dashboard with 16 perfectly working pannels. Please be careful and do
not break anything.

You can see a green light on one of the pannels - it means that
someone is speaking. In this case - it's me.

You can press the "on"/"off" button to stop listening. Please try
turning me off and then on now.

<fast>
Did he press the button? What do you mean we don't know, what if he is
stupid and can't press the button?
</fast>

Now you can hear me again. Your task is to identify persons who use
suspicious words like DECEPTION, KILL, BOMB and FIRE and immediatelly
send a SWAT team when you spot them.

You should never send the SWAT team to the houses of people who are
innocent. NO It's not funny! And all the paperwork we have to do... it
takes so much time...

Now please try and send a SWAT team to me by pressing the Send SWAT
button next to the green light.

...

Press the SWAT button now. Please.

...

It is to the left of the Green light.

...

Hello, is anybody there? Can you hear me? Do you speak english?

...

Heeeey.

...

I am getting bored.

...

You can stop waiting, and just press the SWAT button!

...

I will stop speaking now!

...

PRESS THE BUTTON!

...


If you are listening - at least say thanks to the awesome people who made this game:

Marius Gedminas
Žilvinas Ledas
Egle Zioma
and Ignas

And now - press the SWAT button!

...

I am not here anymore.
