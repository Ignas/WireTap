Story
-----

Welcome to the NSA listening post number seven five three three eleven.
This is the best listening post in all of NSA!

Now you see your work panel. Green light means a listening chanel is active.
You can turn it ON and OFF. Listen to as many channels as you can to improve
your performance. Your task is to identify persons who use suspicious words 
like DECEPTION, KILL, BOMB and FIRE. When you spot one - send a SWAT team 
to his place!
